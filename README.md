# Webscraped Mission to Mars Flask App

## Instructions
*

## Background
Using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter to build a web application that scrapes various websites for data and displays the information in a single HTML page. 

## Details

* Creating a Jupyter Notebook to complete all of your scraping and analysis tasks.

    * Scraping the [NASA Mars News Site](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/) and collecting the latest News Title and Paragraph Text.
    
    * Visiting the url for .

    * Using splinter to navigate JPL Featured Space Image [here](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/?search=&category=Mars) and find  the image url for the current Featured Mars Image.

    * Scraping the latest Mars weather tweet from [Mars Weather twitter account](https://twitter.com/marswxreport?lang=en). 

    * Using Pandas to scrape the [Mars Facts webpage](http://space-facts.com/mars/) table containing facts about the planet including Diameter, Mass, etc.

* Using Pandas to convert the data to a HTML table string.

### Mars Hemispheres

* Visit the USGS Astrogeology site [here](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars) to obtain high resolution images for each of Mar's hemispheres.

* You will need to click each of the links to the hemispheres in order to find the image url to the full resolution image.

* Save both the image url string for the full resolution hemisphere image, and the Hemisphere title containing the hemisphere name. Use a Python dictionary to store the data using the keys `img_url` and `title`.

* Append the dictionary with the image url string and the hemisphere title to a list. This list will contain one dictionary for each hemisphere.

```python
# Example:
hemisphere_image_urls = [
    {"title": "Valles Marineris Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
    {"title": "Cerberus Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
    {"title": "Schiaparelli Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
    {"title": "Syrtis Major Hemisphere", "img_url": "..."},
]
```

## Step 2 - MongoDB and Flask Application

Use MongoDB with Flask templating to create a new HTML page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.

* Start by converting your Jupyter notebook into a Python script called `scrape_mars.py` with a function called `scrape` that will execute all of your scraping code from above and return one Python dictionary containing all of the scraped data.

* Next, create a route called `/scrape` that will import your `scrape_mars.py` script and call your `scrape` function.

  * Store the return value in Mongo as a Python dictionary.

* Create a root route `/` that will query your Mongo database and pass the mars data into an HTML template to display the data.

* Create a template HTML file called `index.html` that will take the mars data dictionary and display all of the data in the appropriate HTML elements. Use the following as a guide for what the final product should look like, but feel free to create your own design.

## Hints

* Use Splinter to navigate the sites when needed and BeautifulSoup to help find and parse out the necessary data.

* Use Pymongo for CRUD applications for your database. For this homework, you can simply overwrite the existing document each time the `/scrape` url is visited and new data is obtained.

* Use Bootstrap to structure your HTML template.
